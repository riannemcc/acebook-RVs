# AceBook - Team Rails Virgins

![](https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article16110362.ece/ALTERNATES/s810/0_East-Coast-Main-Line.jpg)

## The Task

To make our first full stack, 2-week, group project from scratch; a Facebook clone called <span>&#9824;</span>cebook!

## Our Approach

- This was full stack, and none of our team had ever used Rails before so getting up to speed with that framework took a fair amount of time.
- The main objectives of this project were less product and more process.  So CI/CD, Agile and TDD were at the front of our minds, to varying degrees of success...

## Techstack

```
Back-end >> Rails
Front-end >> Javascript, Jquery, HTML, CSS
Testing >> Rspec, CapyBara, Selenium-Webdriver, Rubocop, Simplecov
CI >> Travis CI
CD >> Heroku
```

## Challenges

- Getting the hang of Rails definitely took up a lot of headspace.  Most of us had only used Sinatra before, so having less visibility on routing was a little tricky, and generally the structre was quite overwhelming at first.  But we feel more on top of it now.
- We ended up TDDing very little, mostly we think because we were learning a new technology, so the exploration/implementation phases were very muddled.
-This meant that our CI was more reactive rather than proactive.  Getting our heads around Travis too a while.  But eventually we got it up and running.
- Downstream again with CD we ran into the same problems.  Just remembering to follow all the processes was quite a challenge.
- Our version control and git discpline was a little slack.  Much too much work directly onto the master branch, and there's plenty of orphaned branches lost into the ether.

## Accomplishments

- Our team worked together really well!  We had regular stand-ups every morning, follow by a quick planning and allocation.  We constantly communicated throughout, and had useful retros/merge parties at the end of the day.
- We all feel a lot more confident with Rails.
- We're all pretty pleased with the Front-End/aesthetics!  Turned out pretty well.  We were tempted to turn to a more sophistocated framework like React, but we're glad we didn't in the end as we had plenty on our plates already.

## Future goals

- None of us will probably revisit this project but if we did...  There are plenty more features we'd like to add.
- Acebook is sorely lacking a like button, plus a many to many friends feature.
